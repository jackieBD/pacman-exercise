Javacript Pacman Factory Exercise. 

This is a simple coding project that consists of clicking a button to create many pacmen that then bounce around your screen freely. 

**How to Run**

Click the "Add PacMan" button to add a random Pacman to your screen. Then click the "Start Game" button to allow the Pacman to bounce around the screen. 
You may add more Pacmen at anytime. Refresh to clear away the Pacmen and start over.

**Roadmap of future improvements**

There could be many improvements, such as adding more variety of Pacmen. There could be Pacmen of different sizes and colors for example.
Another improvement could be to change the background from white to something more fitting to the Pacman theme.
